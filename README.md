# Klee - Visual Analytics

A course on logging and visualizing metrics related to data and models. 

Garbage-In Garbage Out (GIGO) may be the most widely used maxim in machine learning, but how does one assess the quality of data in an analysis pipeline? How does one understand the results provided by ML models?  In the course we cover two subjects:

1) Analytics - logging relevant metrics for every step in an analysis pipeline.   
2) Visualiztion - the visualization, interpretation, and clear communication the evidence provided by teh analysis logs.
