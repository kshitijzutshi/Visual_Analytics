# Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or a sample of a population.  Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of frequency, measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion or variation (spread), and measures of position.

### Measures of Frequency
* Formulas: Count, Percent, Frequency
* Shows how often something occurs
* Use this when you want to show how often a response is given
### Measures of Central Tendency
* Formulas: Mean, Median, and Mode
* Locates the distribution by various points
* Use this when you want to show how an average or most commonly indicated response
### Measures of Dispersion or Variation
* Formulas: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
* Identifies the spread of scores by stating intervals
* Range = High/Low points
* Variance or Standard Deviation = difference between observed score and mean
* Use this when you want to show how "spread out" the data are.  It is helpful to know when your data are so spread out that it affects the mean
### Measures of Position
* Formulas: Percentile Ranks, Quartile Ranks
* Describes how scores fall in relation to one another. Relies on standardized scores
* Use this when you need to compare scores to a normalized score (e.g., a national norm)

The foundation of any data science project requires analysis using the descriptive statistics found in this project.  The primary goal here was to code descriptive statistics without using built-in functions to allow users to observe the inner-workings of how some of the Python statistics library is comprised.  For further reading, I suggest getting Data Science from Scratch, 2nd Edition by Joel Grus.  Links are provided below to the book and the Python code from the statistics portion of the book on GitHub.

## Using Descriptive Statistics
First, import List from the typing library followed by holding shift and pressing enter.

We will be using the example data sets under the section "Data" to pass through the functions below.  Again, hold shift and press enter.

Throughout this tutorial, there will be a section with the name of the descriptive statistic and the corresponding code followed by an output section that runs that stat using a data set.  Be sure to hold shift and press enter on each cell all the way down.
